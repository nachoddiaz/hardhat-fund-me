# FundMe Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. 
It comes with two sample contracts (fundMe.sol and PriceConverter.sol)
Tests for the contracts in phases unit and staging (FundMe.test.js and FundMe.staging.js)
Two cripts that deploys that contract and those mocks (00-deploy-mocks and 01-deploy-fund-me)

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
test -> to test the project locally
test:staging -> to test the project on the Rinkeby testnet
deploy:rinkeby -> to run the project on the Rinkeby testnet

```
